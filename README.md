The PIC16F1769 Dual Independent LED Channel Demonstration showcases the flexible intelligence of our newest family of PICÂ® Microcontrollers (MCUs). These 8-bit PIC MCUs use its on-chip peripherals to create independent, closed-loop channels. Independently controls two LED strings and automatically adjust modes (ON/OFF, fade and auto), which display the capability of multiple independent mixed-signal channels in a simple 8-bit MCU design. The interconnection of these hardware-based solutions reduces latency, increases system performance, eliminates discrete components and frees the Central Processing Unit (CPU) to perform the task of driving the light-emitting diode (LED) array.
